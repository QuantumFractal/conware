WARNING:EDK:3712 - IPNAME: axi_interconnect, INSTANCE: axi4lite_0 - Frequency of the interconnect's clock port could not be determined. All IPs in the design will be considered to be asynchronous with respect to the interconnect. This will lead to more resource usage. You can avoid this by specifying the clock frequency on the port that the interconnect's clock is connected to.
Assigned Driver axidma 7.02.a for instance axi_dma_0
axi_dma_0 has been added to the project
ERROR:EDK:4125 - IPNAME: axi_dma, INSTANCE: axi_dma_0, PARAMETER: C_BASEADDR - ASSIGNMENT=REQUIRE is defined in the MPD. You must specify a value in the MHS. 
ERROR:EDK:4125 - IPNAME: axi_dma, INSTANCE: axi_dma_0, PARAMETER: C_HIGHADDR - ASSIGNMENT=REQUIRE is defined in the MPD. You must specify a value in the MHS. 
WARNING:EDK:2137 - Peripheral axi_dma_0 is not accessible from any processor in the system. Check Bus Interface connections and address parameters.
